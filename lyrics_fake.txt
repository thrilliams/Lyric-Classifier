the_beatles	I read the news today, oh boy
the_beatles	About a lucky man who made the grade
the_beatles	And though the news was rather sad
the_beatles	Well, I just had to laugh
the_beatles	I saw the photograph
the_beatles	He blew his mind out in a car
the_beatles	He didn't notice that the lights had changed
the_beatles	A crowd of people stood and stared
the_beatles	They'd seen his face before
the_beatles	Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
the_beatles	I saw a film today, oh boy
the_beatles	The English army had just won the war
the_beatles	A crowd of people turned away
the_beatles	But I just had to look
the_beatles	Having read the book
the_beatles	I'd love to turn you on
the_beatles	(One)
the_beatles	Woke up, fell out of bed
the_beatles	Dragged a comb across my head
the_beatles	Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
the_beatles	And looking up, I noticed I was late
the_beatles	(Huh, huh, huh, huh)
the_beatles	Found my coat and grabbed my hat
the_beatles	Made the bus in seconds flat
the_beatles	Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
the_beatles	And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
the_beatles	Ah, ah ah ah
the_beatles	Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
the_beatles	Ah
the_beatles	Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
the_beatles	I read the news today, oh boy
the_beatles	Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
the_beatles	And though the holes were rather small
the_beatles	They had to count them all
the_beatles	Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
the_beatles	I'd love to turn you on
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	And I've been working like a dog
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	I should be sleeping like a log
the_beatles	But when I get home to you
the_beatles	I find the things that you do
the_beatles	Will make me feel all right
the_beatles	You know I work all day
the_beatles	To get you money to buy you things
the_beatles	And it's worth it just to hear you say
the_beatles	You're gonna give me everything
the_beatles	So why on earth should I moan?
the_beatles	'Cause when I get you alone
the_beatles	You know I'll feel okay
the_beatles	When I'm home
the_beatles	Everything seems to be right
the_beatles	When I'm home
the_beatles	Feeling you holding me tight
the_beatles	Tight, yeah
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	And I've been working like a dog
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	I should be sleeping like a log
the_beatles	But when I get home to you
the_beatles	I find the things that you do
the_beatles	Will make me feel all right
the_beatles	Ow!
the_beatles	So why on earth should I moan?
the_beatles	'Cause when I get you alone
the_beatles	You know I feel okay
the_beatles	When I'm home
the_beatles	Everything seems to be right
the_beatles	When I'm home
the_beatles	Feeling you holding me tight
the_beatles	Tight, yeah
the_beatles	Ooh, it's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	And I've been working like a dog
the_beatles	It's been a hard day's night
the_beatles	I should be sleeping like a log
the_beatles	But when I get home to you
the_beatles	I find the things that you do
the_beatles	Will make me feel all right
the_beatles	You know, I feel all right
the_beatles	You know, I feel all right
the_beatles	All I've got is a picture of you
the_beatles	Now that you've gone and left me blue
the_beatles	You don't hear me cry at night
the_beatles	And say sweet things to you
the_beatles	You don't hear me sing a love song to
the_beatles	A picture of you
the_beatles	I pretend that you're still here with me
the_beatles	Laughing just the way we used to be
the_beatles	But pictures they can't talk and they can't see
the_beatles	I know I'm in love and nothing more
the_beatles	Nothing more
the_beatles	I hope you'll be happy where you are
the_beatles	But if you need me I won't be to far
the_beatles	Standing in the shadow of my dreams
the_beatles	They say it's not as bad as it may seem
the_beatles	But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do
the_beatles	They don't realise that all I got
the_beatles	Is a picture of you
the_beatles	Well, if your hands start a-clapping and your fingers start a-popping
the_beatles	And your feet start a-moving around
